Dear God in Heaven, I feel for you
I'll hang for you, I feel for you

I won't do anything, I won't do anything

I need alcohol
To open my blood
I need alcohol
To empty my head
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol

I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol

I need alcohol





Pink little lamb, on a granite slab
Black chasm creeping, forever leaking
Oh universe
Sing in reverse
Oh sucking lung
We'll never come
Forever loving!
Forever waiting!


Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
The universal mind!


Eye full of sun, hand full of mud
Oh universe: you stink of love!
Forever lazy
Forever crazy
Forever holy
Forever hungry
Forever hateful
Forever beautiful
Forever needing
Forever reaching
Forever stinking
Forever breathing
Forever growing
Forever leaving


Oh shit and blood!
Forever love!
No ebb or flood, will ever come!
Oh shit and blood!
Forever love, love, love!
Forever draining
Forever leaving
And what's my name?
And what's my name?


Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
The universal mind!





I see them all lined up
Like naked children at the wall
Their skin is hanging off in sheets
Each face is painted like a whore
Their blood is shining in the sun
Their wounds are powdered with white salt
Their lips are shaping silent words:
I see my name as it spills out
I see them walking on their knees
Led in a chain by laughing girls
I see them sucking on the dirt
As if inhaling the whole world
And one by one their throats are cut
And each one sings his choking song
And each one sings his lullaby
And each one falls and then he's gone


And I feel good
Yeah I feel fine
Yeah I feel good
And I've been waiting far too long


I see their bodies in the pyre
Leaking black smoke into the flames
And all the people stand around
Shaping lips into my name
And soon the sun begins to sink
Behind a wall of dirty air
I see their bones there in the pile
And taste the smell of burning hair
And all the children howl for milk
The rain spits down a million knives
I see you running through the field
I see you running for your useless life
I feel you choking on your tongue
I feel your breath attack your chest
The dogs are ripping at your feet
I see you bleeding out your happiness


And I feel good
Yeah I feel fine
And I feel good
I finally got back what was always rightfully mine




The sun is an acid eye
We're corroded with pleasure inside
There's a hole in your thin white skin
Now we'll never be clean again

Our hands are two broken claws
We scrape at the ground for hours
I buried this sound in the floor
To gain control of this feeling
(Amnesia)

And this city's a crowded room
And the earth is a closing tomb
In my hand is your perfect womb
When you breathe, your breath is obscene

My heart is a lead box
Ideas are shutting locks
The air was just turned off
Now you're sucking from this machine
(Amnesia)

The sun will not rise today
You children will stay where you lay
The oil is black and it's thick
And sex is a void filled with plastic

The President's mouth is a whore
When there's murder, the audience roars
There's no room left here for the strong
And everything human's necessarily wrong
(Amnesia)

Somewhere, through the frozen fields
Somewhere, beneath your pale and tender skin
Lies a house, absorbing fear and pain
Solar, red, contained, feeding on my dreams


Somewhere cold, inside the optic wire
Down where fingers and semen crack and bleed
There I will be, with my arms spread out and broken
Waiting for your breath, to animate my veins


We're not alone: all our thoughts are numbered
Malignant and cold, animal and hungry
But I will contain all that ever was or will be
Then I'll watch my skin erupt in a symphony of flames


Screaming out your name
Screaming out


Why can't I hide inside your malleable electric face?
You'd suck away the pain and swallow down my sickest dreams
Now my body feels like snow spilling out the shattered screen
Where will we be then when all the fear and blood are gone?
Drained into one hundred million open children's mouths


Screaming out your name
Screaming out
Screaming out




I'll walk fifteen steps across the room
I'll stay there until I know where I am
I won't move until I know where I am
I won't move until I (until I) remember where I am (until I)
I won't move until I remember (remember)
Until I (until I) remember (remember)
I should have hurt you (I should have hurt you)
I couldn't hurt you (I couldn't hurt you)
So I let you hurt me (so I let you hurt me)
Because I need you (because I need you)




Force yourself on me
I know where my money comes from
I'll do anything for you
When your hands in my mouth I'll force it down
When your hands in my mouth
I'll force it down in me
Hold it in, take it out of me
Hold it in, take it out
Take it out of me
Push me, I'll move
I'll do anything for you





Through a door in the air
On a crumbling stair
In a clear and rushing vein
In a tunnel full of rain
In a piece of yellow light
On the skin of my eye
Are you there?


In the wind of my lung
In methane and in love
In petroleum plumes
There's a floating slice of moon
In your tooth and your claw
And your unforgiving jaws
Are you there?


On a burning white ship
In the taste of her lips
In the blood of the swans
As the sun fucks the dawn
In the mud of the lake
In the drunk and the dazed
Are you there?


In the now that is not
On a ladder to God
On a mountain stripped bare
With your hand in my hair
Behind the face of the sky
On a disappearing line
Are you there?


In the then that was now
In the now that is not
In our names we forgot
In a thought we just lost
We become what we choose
We are stumbling fools
Who are not there


There's some tangled dirty twine
In some idiot's clouded mind
There's some wires that won't unwind
Around the ankles of the blind
There's some walls lined with soft lead
And in that room is your bed
Is that really you?


Are you in there?
On the moon?
In the air?
Crushed in my hand?
Thrown in a fire?




Here is "A Piece of the Sky." My hope is that this long intro will just keep growing and growing. Frankly, I'm a little in the dark right now about how that will be accomplished. But I'm confident that it will be revealed. The song part, I don't know why somehow I want it to have the feel of one of the ballads from The Rolling Stone's Sticky Fingers or Neil Young's Harvest. But more cinematic somehow if I can use that word. I think it might involve strings. Oh, I guess this song is like a prayer to our creator. I'm not sure

These are the things I hold onto
These are the things I use to deceive myself
I line them up in front of me
I judge them carefully
Then I throw them all away
I throw them all away
I am a small man
I am not a dangerous man


I love a child
I love a beautiful child

I love a beautiful idea


I will hold this child in my arms
And will caress his soft head
Listen to him cry
Listen to him cry


I could kill the child

I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

Sit here, now look in the mirror
Something's wrong, your face is distorted
Feel the flow, there's blood in your body
And you can see clearly every heartbeat you make

Close your eyes, touch your mouth in the mirror
That's the wound that is made where the past meets the future
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

I can see clearly through this veil of reality
And I can remember the feel of your skin
No, you never knew me and you never will
When nothing's there, nothing is concealed

I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

We're better than you are
Yes, we're better than you
We're better than you are
Yes, we're better than you

Say you'll do anything for me
Say you'll do anything for me
Say you'll do what you don't understand

Now some of us are weak
And some endure
And some people live their life
In violence that’s pure and clean
But I saw a man cry once
Down on his knees
In the corner of a darkened cell
And his pain meant nothing to me


But I was younger then
And young men never die
When I walked out in the sun
I was strong, clear-minded and blind


I don’t say a prayer for anyone
It doesn’t do any good
Please don’t ask me questions
They’d just be misunderstood
And if you could step inside me
You'd feel what hatred brings
And if you saw with my eyes
You'd see what self-deception means


I was younger once
And I created a lie
And though my body was strong
I was self-deluded, confident and blind


Now show some pity
For weak of will
Because when we’re drinking
We can never be filled
Show some understanding
For the lonely fool
Because when I’m drinking
I’m out of control


I was never young
Nothing has transpired
But when I look in the mirror
I feel dead, I feel cold, I am blind


I am blind, mmm
I am blind, mmm
I am blind, mmm
Mmm




Hold onto my hand
Hold onto my unborn hand
Feel what I'll never be
Need me badly
Need what I have
Need what I am

I am a dead man
Now I am a dead man
I am selfish
I am unborn
I am unborn now
I am unborn

Need my love
Need my fake love
Hold onto my hand
Hold onto my unborn hand
Need what I make you become

Blind love
Blind love

I am a dead man
I am a cold dead man
And I am unkind
I am unkind

Feel my hand
Feel my dead hand
Need my love
Need my blind love

Love blind
Blind love
Feel good
Feel good now
Love
Now




I found you lying where I drowned you
I found you lying where I lay with you
Where I threw you in the water
Where I drowned you in the river

Where I watched you roll away
Where I watched your body roll away
Roll away
Roll away

From everything we think we know
We'll lie down in the warm green grass
And the sun will shine on our pale shape
Our blood will flow black in the dirt
And a black rose will grow where we laid




There's blood on your hands, baby
Baby, there's blood on your hands
Mama's gonna get even with you
Mama's gonna get you back
When all the blood's washed over you mama will never forget
Mama loves you too much, baby
Mama loves you too much to cry
Mama loves her darling boy
She'll hold you close in her arms
Mama's gonna wash his sweet body
Mama loves you too much to cry
Mama loves you too much, baby
Mama loves you too much to cry





We are poor little lambs who have lost our way
Baa, baa, baa


When silence falls
And light remains
And time is born
Beneath the Sun
I'll hide your name
Inside a word
And paint your eyes
With false perception
And I feel your mind
In everything
And every breath
Destroys a sound
And I never will follow
A false sensation
And I'll always believe
Your blood promise


Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na


And every breath
I stole from you
And I never will see
Your broken body
And you never have spoken
An unclear word
And I'll never betray
Your blood promise


Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na


Don't stop!

Well, we are done
And we'd like to thank you for being here-
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

You're too close
I don't recognize your smell
You're in the wrong skin
I don't recognize your smell
Your mouth smells strange
Some people want to kill you
Some people want to fuck you
When you say the wrong word
You could be screwing yourself
When you act the wrong way
When you do the wrong thing
You could be screwing yourself
Don't be a whore
You could be screwing yourself




Come down off your throne and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

Come down on your own and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key

But I can't find my way home

But I can't find my way home
Still I can't find my way home
And I ain't done nothing wrong
But I can't find my way home





The secret sign of a charmed existence
Is the shiny liquid on her lips
And the ecstasy that comes with her image grows
From the power that the money gives
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
She's just floating in space
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
All her children want a suck and a taste of
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle
Yeah, her celebrity life
And she's just a drug addiction
And a self-reflecting image of a narcotized mind


The secret wisdom of 120 days
Is hidden deep in between her legs
And sexual transcendence is reserved for the wealthy
But is only one joy that money can make, yeah
She's got a celebrity lifestyle
And she's got a glowing white face, yeah
She's got a celebrity lifestyle
And she ties her naked children up with wires and lace
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle is the
Product of a celebrity mind, yeah
Oh, her celebrity mouth is the
Perfect image of the end of time


Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle

Within the walls of Eden prison
There is a mark upon a stone
And in this place a life was written
And there a stain was laid where I was born
Now, moving through the roots of trees
Deep may their fingers reach
The substance of a mind that feeds
The bodies of the living stones that lead
Up to become the walls of Eden prison

The supine wild beast upon the slab
Would gladly rip the throat from God
If only he could reach up to his white ass
And I am free and will never breathe again
Within the greasy ochre walls of Eden prison
I am free, I will begin again
I am free of the choking hold that began in Eden prison

We are free

But the ships, they sail a sea of glistening turning crimson
They are carrying a cargo to unload at Eden prison





You were wrong to resist me
I was wrong to forgive
Now I loathe my own weakness
But you praise me for this


There's a place in your future
Where the wound will be healed
And the children you injured
Will rise up, purified, then kill your name




You're afraid of the mirror
So you crawl on the floor
Where you count your perversions
Then you rise up
Filthy, with remorse


Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah




And I, I've been lonely
And I, I've been blind
And I, I've learned nothing
So my hands are firmly tied
To the sinking lead weight of failure

I've worked hard all my life
Money slips through my hands
My face in the mirror tells me
It's no surprise that I am
Pushing the stone up the hill of failure

And they tempt me with violence
And they punish me with ideals
And they crush me with an image of my life
That's nothing but unreal
Except on the goddamned slaveship of failure

And I'll drown here trying
To get up for some air
But each time I think I breathe
I'm laid on with a double share
Of the punishing burden of failure

I don't deserve to be down here
But I'll never leave
And I,  I've learned one thing
You can't escape the beast
In the null and void pit of failure

When I get my hands on some money
I'll kiss its green skin
And I'll ask its dirty face
"Where the hell have ya been?"
"I'm the fuel that fires the engines of failure"

And I'll be old and broken down
And I'll forget who and where I am
I'll be senile or forgotten
But I'll remember and understand
You can bank your hard-earned money on failure

I saw my father crying
I saw my mother break her hand
On a wall that wouldn't weep
But that certainly held in
The mechanical moans of a dying man who was a failure

My back hurts me when I bend
'Cause I carry a load
And my brain hurts like a knife-hole
Because I've yet to be shown
How to pull myself out from the sucking quicksand of failure

Some people lie in Hell
Many bastards succeed
But I, I've learned nothing
I can't even elegantly bleed
Out the poison blood of failure









(Shhhhhhhh)
I'm truly sorry
For what I never did
But I forgive you, too;
For your indifference
You're a lonely child
Laid open to the world
And when I looked in your eyes
I saw myself there too
So please forgive me now
For what we never had
Although its useless to say
I wish you happiness
I wish you happiness
I wish you happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness...
(whistling)





With glittering hands
On collapsible land
We're praising the sun
For the damage he's done
A ruinous eyesore
Oh what is a mind for?
Just a knife in a lake
Just an arrow in space
All creation is hollow
And a picture's a shadow
Just a symptom of love
With a lack of a cause
Now the city's dissolving
And heaven's inhaling
While the ocean is thinking
Of a surface reflecting:


Your glorious mind, your glorious mind
Your glorious mind, your glorious mind
Your glorious mind, your glorious mind
Your glorious mind, your glorious mind
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)

Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Mine, mine
Mine, mine
Mine, mine

Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

I'll lie down here, I'll lie down here
I'll lie down beside you, I'll lie down beside you
I'll lie to myself, I'll lie to myself
I'll believe in myself, I'll believe in myself

Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

I'll crawl all over myself and stand in your shadow
I'll crawl all over myself and stand in your arms
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself

Come here you freak, I saw you crawling last night
Big erection in your hand, you rule the world
You're gonna murder somebody weak
You're gonna murder somebody weak
Strong men win at violence and abuse
Strong men win at violence and abuse
Strong men win at violence and abuse


I'm not scared, I'll take what I want
Something for nothing, I want what you've got
I want what you've got





Cut out the infection
Beat up the violator
Gag him and screw him down
Screw him down


Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail


Knock him down

Cut off his deception

Murder his influence

When
When we were young
We had no history
So nothing to lose


Meant we could choose
Choose what we wanted then
Without any fear
Or thought of revenge


But then you grew old
And I lost my ambition
So I gained an addiction
To drink and depression


They are mine
My only true friends
And I'll keep them with me
Until the very end


I'd choose not to remember
But I miss your arrogance
And I need your intelligence
And your hate for authority


But now you're gone
I read it today
They found you in Spain
Face down in the street


With a bottle in your hand
And a wild smile on your face
And a knife in your back
You died in a foreign land


And they found my letter
Rolled up in your pocket
Where I said I'd kill myself
If she left me again


So now she's gone
And you're both in my mind
I've got one thing to say
Before I am drunk again


God damn the sun
God damn the sun
God damn anyone
That says a kind word
God damn the sun
God damn the sun
God damn the light it shines
And this world it shows
God damn the sun




And all across America
The poison fires glow
And in the blood of our procreation
Annihilation grows

Yes, love was made for slaves like us
Designed to fetishize
Consumption, waste and an identity
Based on a dying lie

So God forgive America
The end of history is now
And God may save the victim
But only the murderer holds real power

We came across the seas
We'd fill with offal and disgust
And any object industry required
We bought, enslaved or we crushed

And now our minds are as naked
As the paradise we stripped
And our reward is our entropy
Our emptiness is our gift

So God forgive America
And every human on this Earth
And God forgive the ruined lives
And nothing is what it's worth




You're body is warm
You're hiding yourself
Nothing will go wrong
You're hiding yourself

Sleep on this bed
Cover yourself
Nothing will go wrong
Protect yourself

Sleep on this bed
Hold on to yourself
Nothing will go wrong
Nothing will go wrong





Permission is bloodless
Ambition is senseless


Don't make a wrong move
Work with a purpose
Work with a purpose


You win or you lose
Imitate a slave


Don't make a wrong move
Learn from experience, learn from experience


Don't be useless
Waste is obscene, waste is obscene
Waste is obscene


Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move




It's alright, we're in heaven
This is heaven, we're in heaven
The Earth is moving
Our body's broken
Our bodies breathing
Our blood is moving
It's alright, we're in heaven
It's alright, we're in heaven





Now you be the mother and
I'll be your fool
I'll hide myself deep inside
Your crimson pool
The muddy water runs
Beneath your folds
You won't let me breathe;
You won't let me go
Now you'll be the stranger and
I'll be the white-skinned son
You'll blacken my innocence
With sugar and opium


The children were suffocating
Down in your damp cave
And you were the mother
And I was the sleeping slave
Protect me from violence
Hold me in your cool lips
You'll drug me with kindness
So I can pretend I exist
Now you be the only child
I'll suck on your breast
You'll feed me with gasoline
I'll burn my name in your head






I'll walk with you
Through space and time
And when sleep is near
I will fold you in

I'll disappear with you
In clear blue flames
And when our time arrives
We will slide through space







Thing is er
We're at a stage now
Last night just before bedtime I wondered where she was
I thought I heard the hi-fi going, the stereo
And I opened the, living room door and she was pressed down on the, Davenport, with er, some kind of her, favorite music going, and had, er, incense burning, and er the lights out, lying in the dark
I guess she was mooning over that boyfriend





It's not as much a deterioration fact it's the disease I have
Which er, uh, the- the right eye is blind as you know
And that was done, er, unfortunately
As- as a result of a detached retina
And the retina they could never splice together
They tried to seal it together and couldn't
And told me I'd lose my eyesight at that y'know
O- o- o- short or long term I would lose it
And unfortunately ... er the ... retinal er ah er
A retinal det- detachment started in my left eye
My good eye, which I still have today
And it was the result of glaucoma...
And ... a retinal ... not detachment but a retinal ... er, er
I don't know what the hell they call it, it's er ... that does it
Today er zer zer
I am what they call legally
Because of this retinal problem and er glaucoma, er
I- I'm what they call ... erm ...
Legally blind




Today I do not have a fever
I feel about the same as I ... did yesterday
I- I'm trying to eat a little better, so I can get stronger
(You exercising?)
I'm exercising by just walking around the, around the house
Went out in the yard just Wednesday
(You have a headache?)
No, I don't think I have a headache
(A little dizzy, today?)
Maybe slightly dizzy
(You feel weaker? Or stronger than you did yesterday?)
Just o- just overnight
I don't seem to be much different over one
Over one night yesterday to today
Takes a little bit longer than that
(Any aches and pains anywhere? Or on when you fell?
Or when you fell on your heater, having your exercise?)
Well, that's the, that's sore, about where I fell on the heater
(Where?)
Here, well I guess here
(Where is that?)
I dunno what you call that
(Ain't it hurt when you breathe)

It hurts a little bit when I breathe in a little deeply
(D'you sleep at all?)
Well if you're asleep you can't tell whether you're asleep





Can I steal your mind?
And can I crawl down inside?
And when I am your child
Can I feed in your eye?
And can I drink the air
Down in your cold black lung?
And can I breathe the sweet
Sick and lonesome blood?


Love is everywhere
No we will never escape
I love you more than my life
No, we will never escape


Can I cut out the core
And steal the food in your head
And curl my body inside
Down where it's dark and it's wet?


I love you more than your life
I love your body and mind
I love you more than your life
No, we will never escape




And I am the sun
I rise above the world
And when the light goes out
I kill another child
And I am insane
I crawl into your mouth
I grow like a flower
I grow a suicide
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
And I am the light (I love everyone)
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)

And I am the dog
I cut out my eyes
Yeah I will nullify
My true love creation
And I am the sun
I love everyone
I live inside your chest
I grow like a cancer
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)

I love everyone
I love everyone
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone
(I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone)




You're my father
I obey you
I want you to be my father
I want you to be my father
You know what I am
You know what I am
I want you to kill me
I'm weak

Take what's mine
Make me feel good
Make me feel soft
Come into my room
Put your hands on my throat
Now choke me
We'll die

Make me nothing
Make me nothing
Be my father
Be my father
Think for me
Make it right
Think for me
Make it right

Put your hands on my throat
Choke me
We'll ride




Now I'm breathing the breath of God
And the cold wind cleans my mind
And I'm standing in a ring of fire
And my heart is made of light

And I fly across the red mountains
And my hands contain the sky
And the earth rolls away in darkness
And I ride a piece of lightning
Killing time
Killing time

Now they punish our imagination
And corrupt our blood with fear
And infinity's beneath the ocean
But oblivion sits right beside me here

So we are blind and we're polluted
And each breath is drunk with tears
We'll drift away across tomorrow
And we'll ride the breath of nothing through the years
Killing time
Killing time




I love myself
I was made for myself
If I kissed you I lied
I am made to be admired
You made a mistake
When you pressed your lips to mine
I inhale what I see
I steal what I breathe
You are mine only mine
You are mine only mine
I will swallow you
I will swallow you
You are mine only mine
I will swallow you
I will swallow you
I will swallow you














In my garden
Things grow in my garden
Things will grow
Then they die

Then they fall away
Then they're gone
In my garden
In my garden

We'll never grow old
We'll never grow old

In my garden
Where the dew never dries
In my garden

In my garden
These roses
These black orchids are our friends

In my garden
When we breathe
When we breathe this air

We will breathe in these things
We will breathe in these things

In my garden
In my garden
We'll never die
We'll never die
In my garden
In my garden




The engine divine is inside Madeline
The stardust is yellow and red
And its mapping out of time inside of her head

Now there's always Madeline
Rising up from where our limbs intertwined
Now walking a random invisible line
Clutching like snow to the side of the vine

You are free, free to do nothing
You are free to drift across the sky
You are free to be a shape just becoming
Now you're free, inside Madeline

Dropping a tear in the palm of my hand
Making her mark in desicate land
Bring light to Madeline
Bring new life to Madeline




No, we have never been here
And we will never be gone
I saw your voice rise up
And cut into the heart of the sun

I kissed the lips of a girl
She took her first breath when this world was young
I felt the cold of the air
As it burned my empty lungs

And we have never been born and we will be consumed
And unreality is buried here beneath the truth
And though we've never been here, we will never be contained
And unreality is naked here beneath the moon

So we'll go down to the ocean
And wash our memory clean
We'll see the world for the first time
Through an unburied eye

And though the world will stay the same
And we're certain to die
We'll raise our hands up to Heaven
And sacrifice our limitations

And the pain and frustration
Are equal to the bliss of release
And in the eyes of nature
We will live for an eternity

And when we die, we'll disappear
Into the eyes of nature
And we are here just for a little while
And then our body disappears

Into the eyes of nature
Into the arms of God
Into the mouth of indifference
Into the eyes of nature

And we are nothing but experience
In the eyes of nature
And we will live forever
In the eyes of nature




When other people say you're someone to misuse
Shut in behind your young girl's face
And helpless in your bed of thorns
I'll remember who you are
Yes, I'll remember who you are
I'll remember who you are
A young girl, unchained

Come back here now
I know you're somewhere still alive
Strong behind your young girl's tears
I know you're somewhere, unchanged

Oh, I remember who you are
Yes, I remember who you are
I remember who you are
A young girl, unchained

There stands a young girl, naked
In her innocence unused
And she holds me in her small hand
And she smiles down on me

I am innocent in her dark eyes
I will lose my heart in the sand
You're cruel, but you're good for me
And you hold me in your young girl's hand

I remember who you are
Yes, I remember who you are
I remember who you are
A young girl, unchained







Testing... one, two, three
Well... well fuck, haha
I mean, I just don't know what to say
I'm very glad to be here with you tonight
I'll be able to talk to you about some things...
That I know a great deal about
Everyone knows that you are fucked up
And everyone knows that I am fucked up
But, does everyone know
That you are more fucked up than me?
Well, I know that
And you know that
But our purpose is to tell everyone that
Take for instance the time
You went to the bathroom, to take a shower
You had soap, you had a towel, shampoo, washcloth, a brush
Everything was set
But you had to call me to come turn on the water for you
You didn't know where or how
That is one instance of how fucked up you are
A second instance of how fucked up you are:
You was going to cook you some breakfast
Well you went in there
And you put some toast in the toaster
Put a skillet on the stove, some grease in it
You got you some eggs out, some bacon
Poured you some orange juice and made you some coffee
Got some jelly and some butter, fried eggs, salt
Pepper, got the bacon on the grill...
Everything was fine -- except for one thing
You had to call me in there... to show you how to use a fork
Now a third instance, the way you're fucked up:
You got dressed, ready to go to school
Everything was fine. Went outside, got in your car
Key in the ignition
Except for one thing
You had to call me to come show you...




I live in an empty house
There's no one there but memory and me

But I loved a woman once
One hundred years ago, for a while
When she left here, she was filled with hatred
And with a second child

Now, I heard nothing ever changes
But nothing I touch has stayed the same
Everything just turns to poison
That I have loved or made

So bury my children's children
In a deep and lonely grave
Anything is a cause for sorrow
That my mind or body has made

There's a fire on the water
There's a hole in the sky
There's the Devil coming down for me
To this room where I'll die

There's a man with a black heart
He's standing there up on the hill
He's lifting up with his burning hands
A fire that does not kill

He's calling down to me alone
He's calling down to me alone
He says, "Get down on your knees and cry alone
No one will cry for you"

So Jane Mary, cry one tear
Jane Mary, cry just one tear for me
Jane Mary, cry one tear
Jane Mary, cry just one tear for me




It's time to sleep
It's time to leave
To loose the binds
To lose a mind
Time to exhale
To drink the green sea
To drift upon the scarlet breeze
It's time, it's time, it's time to begin
It's time, it's time, it's time to just leave

Let's raise up our hands in prayer
Walk barefoot upon this carpet of air

Let's string up the man
At the top of the stairs
Let's piss on the city
That's burning down there

Jim, Jim, Jim, oh Jim
Jim, Jim, it's time to begin
Ride your mechanical beast to heaven
Ride your beautiful bitch to the ultimate sin

Don't cry, sweet plum, no regrets
We will strangle you up in the loft

These methedrine teeth are piled up in the sink
And your mother is screaming to finish him off

Now heaven will come, we will rise again
Heaven will come, we will win
It is 200 miles to the place where we begin
Yes heaven will come, we will win...





Cut off the arms
Cut off the legs
Cut off the head
Get rid of the body

And I sleep in the belly of a man
And I sleep in the belly of rhythm

I sleep in the belly of oceans

I couldn't stop myself
I knew I'd do it again
But I could heal myself
If I could feel your skin
And if I comprehend this moment
I know we'll live again
And if I heal your wound
We will make love again
And now we're slipping through this millennium
We should feel sorry for the people
And can I kiss your skin?
And there is hunger in the desert
And missiles in the sky
And every soul is interwoven
Before the wrong or right


I know we'll live again
Though it's just a feeling
I know we'll never end
Now there is no beginning
And when it's cold at night
I'll kiss your velvet sleeve
I know we'll never end
I'll keep you company


They keep me company
Ah, ah, ah
They keep me company
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah





May moonlight fall upon your breast
May god send wind to lick your lips
The river flows beneath your comb
Granite, pines
Silver, shine
Green velvet throne
Folding in, folding in
The water brings
The flower string
Folding in, folding in
The water sings
The black horse scream
May planets crash
May god rain ash
To sear our skin
To fold us in
Kneeling close
Seeking hands
Our blood is warm
But what comes next?


I will let it go, I will let it go
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I will let it go, I will let it go
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I won't let it go, I won't let it go
I will let it go, I will let it go
I can let it go, I won't let it go
I will let it go, I can't let it go
I will let it go, I won't let it go
I will let it go, I can't let it go





Choking while laughing
The dog splits open
His steel heart cracks
And his blood pumps out on the sidewalk
On the sidewalk
On the sidewalk
On the sidewalk
On the sidewalk
On the sidewalk
On the sidewalk
On the sidewalk


You laugh out loud
The sound hangs in the air
And discolors the walls
And poisons your mind
It sticks to your mind
It sticks to your mind
It sticks to your mind
It sticks to your mind
It sticks to your mind
It sticks to your mind


Bolt the door shut
And sit down at the table
While hiding your teeth
Your insides split open
You choked on a laugh
You choked on a laugh
You choked on a laugh
You choked on a laugh
You choked on a laugh
You choked on a laugh
You choked on a laugh
You choked on a laugh
You choked on a la....




Some men are made of steel and blood
Some fall from Heaven when their time does come
Some of us, we run from a shapeless form
And some men, they hide from a howling storm

Now I will wander through the falling flames
And I will drown in the burning rain
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down

There is a place with nothing to gain
There lies the lover who has broken no chain
He sits by the window and he stares at the dark
She feels for the knife that will split his heart

Now we are betrayed in the cold, black pain
And a fire will rain down again and again
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down




Out of our head
Out of our mind
Into your hands
Into your eye

Warm in your mouth
Warm in your mind
Warm in your belly
Just like a drug

Sha la la la (x4)

Cool on your tongue
Soft in your hands
Down on the floor
Red in your mind

Out of our head
Out of our mind
Into your head
Just like a drug

Sha la la (x4)

Hard in your hands
Hard in your mind
Hard in your belly
Hard in your face

Down on the floor
Hard in your mind
Into your head
Just like a drug

Sha la la la (x9)




Please open my mind and take what's left
Please fill this cup, with senseless bliss
Let me sup, oh, let me suck upon that which does not exist
Teach the weak, oh, teach me please, to cease to resist
Through halls of glass, through tunnels of chrome
Through corridors of burnished stone
Through fields of crystal and the shards of my bones
May I open my eyes, but not see what I am shown



May i find my way to the reason to come home
May i find my way to the foot of your throne
May I find your arms around my neck
And may I find your little mouth inside of this bed

Love will save you
When the ocean splits itself in two
Love will save you
When the cold wind blows right through you
Love will save you
When the poison eats the precious air
And love will save you
From the snake that crawls around down there


But it won't save me


Love will save you
From the evil and the greed of ignorant men
And love will save you
From the guilt you feel when you betray your only friend
Love will save you
From yourself when you lose control
And love will save you
From all the lies your lover ever told you


But it won't save me


Love will save you
From the truth when you think you're free
Love will save you
From the cold light of boring reality
Love will save you
From the corruption of your lazy-minded soul
And love will save you
From your selfish and distorted goals


But it won't save...


Love will save you
From the black night and the lightning and the ghost
Love will save you
From your misery, then tie you to the bloody post
Love will save you
From the hands that pull you down beneath the sea
And love may save all you people
But it will never, never save me


No, it won't save
Me




When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed, our respect runs so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

You cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Is it something so good, just can't function no more

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again




When they crucify your body
On the white wall above your bed
The words your body bleeds down
Will describe my happiness
The joy l'm feeling now
As the universe withdraws
Is equal to the pain
My mother choked out from her jaws
As she endured without complaint
Then laid me out into the sun
Like some skin from in her throat
Like a living piece of scum
Like a red sack full of failure
Infested with my future crumbs
Of pleasure pain and fear and hatred
And hunger for your helpless tongue
With your naked back on gravel scraping
And your claws hooked in my neck
You know l'm just your little infant crawling
Down your bloody stinking mess
And all you people I once knew
You betrayed me once too much
L'd like to sew your eyelids shut
While planting seeds of hatred in your guts
Then masturbating slow and lazy
I'll feel the pain that you'll soon feel
When my memories infect you
With the disease that never heals





In the mind of no one
Forming sun, forming love
Break the chain, hide within
Innocence, not innocent
Innocent in no sense
Eat the beast, keep him in
Take the blame, speak the name


Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy


Hide beneath, your monkey skin
Feel his love, nurture him
Kill the truth or speak the name


Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy

There's a place in space where violence and love collide inside
And solid is wide
And heat it is cold
And birth is death
And creation and time are made from destruction
From fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Now ride! ride! ride! ride!
Now ride! ride! ride! ride!
Ride! ride! ride! ride!
Ride!




Throw your mind away
Fall into the sea
There's nothing solid here
Dissolve your body today
There's a sun in the sky
We're in the atmosphere
Throw yourself in the sea
There's nothing solid down here

(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound

This ordinary night
This ordinary day
They're twisted out of shape
Then they disintegrate
Cool water runs through the ground
The ocean blends with the air
Throw yourself in the fire
There's nothing solid down here

(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, soundless light

The world was over today
The time is already gone
Throw your mind in the sea
Eternity doesn't last very long
There's some people on Earth
They live in separate minds
Dissolve your body today
There is no more outside

(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, soundless light
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound

There's been a lot of upsetting...
Very upsetting things
That I can't allow to happen any more
I have to be like a soldier and march away
Cause I'm very delicate in a lot of ways
And things get to me
And affect me in a very adverse... manner
I don't need that
Don't need that
I feel now like minus something, you know
I feel faded; I don't feel like I'm all here
I think it'll come back; I hope it'll come back
There's a lot of color missing, from the way I feel
And from ... my face, and, you know, just everything
There's some kind of zest, or some kind of, um ... life
You know, that seems to be faded temporarily
Because I've been so drained, emotionally
By a number of things
That has to slowly build back up
And then it has to be kept sustained
It cannot be allowed to be diminished
*sigh*




She holds a key to the room down there
And I, I will follow, but I'll never fall in
Yeah, we'll suffer for nothing and we'll never forgive
God said to no one to do what he did

One second in your presence is a miracle of love
One second denied is a miracle of love

The young man is weak now in a lover's disguise
The woman is strong in her warm, bed of lies
How will they hold what they can never perceive?
And how do they love what they fail to deceive?

One second in your memory is a miracle of lies
One heartbeat in your body is a miracle of love
White light on a black sky is a miracle from above
One lonely moment in your arms is the miracle of love




Tonight, I'll spend the night in Mona Lisa's bed
She'll hide this beaten man beneath her innocence
Tonight, no dream's denied in Mona Lisa's mind
We'll ride a drowning world through the cold black sky

Mona Lisa, Mother Earth
Mona Lisa, Mother Earth

My mind's an ocean in Mona Lisa's hand
She dreams a hiding world where the water runs red
Tonight, my dreams are born on Mona Lisa's breast
We'll walk a burning world where the sun shines darkness

Mona Lisa, Mother Earth
Mona Lisa, Mother Earth

Mother, don't come near me
Near me
Mother, you disgust me
I need my greed, mother
I need my greed, mother
Mother, my body disgusts me
I need my greed
Mother, my scents disgust me
Mother, your body disgusts me
I hate my greed
I hate my greed, mother
I hate your smell

I need your dirty hands on me 
You disgust me 
I need your dirty hands on me
I need my greed
I need your dirty hands on me
Mother, you disgust me







In and out and in and out again
In and out and in and out again


And where are you now
O Mother of the world?
Ah we feed from your hands
And we drink from your filth and your oil
So send them down
To scrape and suck the soil
Keep us safe inside
Your damp and rusty coil


In and out and in and out again
In and out and in and out again


Mother sun
Mother of senseless things
Mother come
Kill time as it begins




And I'll sleep in the sea
And I'll wait there beneath the mud
And forgotten dreams and disease
And what's the secret I'll drain from your soul
And sweet is the sugar I'll drink from your skull
And where is the wound that shines the blue light
And who is the dead man my body made love to last night

And I'll sleep in the sea
And I'll wait there beneath the mud
And forgotten dreams and disease
And what's the secret I'll drain from your soul
And sweet is the sugar I'll drink from your skull




Then I strangled your neck. Because I love you too much
Then I kissed your red mouth, because I love you to death
Now mother I need you- I need your claws in my neck
Every breath that i breath in, feeds the life that I lack...

Now right here I was born, in the place where you kneeled
In a burning white sand, in the blood that you spilled
Far far in the distance, I hear the howl of the beast
I feel his breath on my face. I feel the edge of his teeth...

And I'll swallow your sorrow, and I'll inhale your fear
And i steal your tomorrows, and I'll inject your tears
So please never forgive me, please spit on my name
But I hold on to my memory, and keep me to blame

Please need me to blame, need me to blame




My frozen, empty, violent mind caressed the hidden hair that shines
With liquid lust I left behind your body stained with ruined eyes
I cut the skin, concealed the crimes, with liquid hate I left inside
And loneliness is buried here in rotting holes beneath your fear
Your agony, your twisted struggle, two bodies sink in meat-blood strangled
The smell of death, your tortured gash, enfold me in your mother's arms

Now hold me in your mother's arms
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)

In the place
Where no one knows
Where they were before
Or what they're doing where
They are now
I will be there
With my eyes wide open
I will be there
I will be there


I will be ready
To receive
The new mind
The new mind


Now I am a man
Now I am a man
But I'm nothing now
And God is mine
Yeah God is mine
Yeah my sin is me
And God is mine


Now I am ready
Now I am ready
Now I am ready
To receive
The new mind
The new mind


Now people get ready
Now people get ready
The sex in your soul will damn you to hell
The sex in your soul will damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
I will be there
I will be there
When he calls my number I will be there

I mean nothing to myself
I mean nothing to myself
I'm nothing, I'm nobody
I hate my body, I'm stuck in myself
I'm nothing, I'm nobody
I don't move, I'm stuck in myself
I hate my body, I'm stuck in myself
I'm nothing, I'm nobody
I'm nothing, I'm nobody
Glory! glory! glory!
Glory! glory! glory!




The bridge is long and narrow
The hills are burned by sorrow
The black crow died of blackness
The moon gave up his madness
But when two hearts like ours return
To the open sea
No arm can pull us down
No angel beneath the water
Can never pull us under
Some eyes can seal no secrets
But time erodes a surface
A snake swims the ocean
In an earth that turns for no one
But when two minds like ours dream
In an open sea
No steel door can close us in
No cruel angel at the gate
Will ever seal our fate
The bridge is long and narrow
The hills drown in sorrow
The black crow died of blackness
The moon gave up his madness
But when two hearts like ours return
To the open sea
But when two minds like ours dream
In an open sea
No cruel arm can pull us down
No steel door can close us in
No angel beneath the water
Will ever take us under
In an open sea
We're in an open sea
In an open sea




She'll go down there to nowhere soon
She'll stand there still with her head in the moon
I will be her nowhere man
Where I'll remain until the end

That girl was so much better than me
But it always goes wrong
There's no cure for the lonely
With loneliness she'll sink in the sand
I feel the heat go out of her hand

We were born with our face to the wall
We only have one chance to crawl
When we laid down there, I held your hand
I'll never feel your body again

Cut down the preacher, he just lies
Burn all the books that closed my mind
Destroy it all, it's all untrue
How can I even breathe without you?




In separate sections
The bodies fall
The leaves are purple
The grass is red
I love your music
I love your style
The light inside you
Leaks through your eyes
Na na na na....

The golden liquid
That washed your face
Contain my secrets
And bitter taste
I love your music
I love your throat
The light inside me
Feeds like a golden rope
Na na na na...

And I alone
See through your eyes
And I alone
Will never die
And I alone
Can taste your hand
And I alone
Am sanctified
And I alone
Can smell your hair
And I alone
Feed you the air
And I alone
Can steal steal your breath
And I alone
Prevent your death
And I alone
Am not alone
And I alone
Am not alone...
Na na na na na...

It's the sun
It's the sun
Sh-sh-shining
Sh-sh-shining...
Shhhh....
Shhhh....




See that man - ego (inner man - hollow)
Soul of man - fallow (hollow man - ego)
See that man - zero ( zero man - hallow)
Inner man - hollow (fallow man - ego)...
See that man - hollow

See that man - hollow (hater man - evil)
See that man - follow (hater man - evil)
Hater man - zero

Long may he live. Long may he live
Long may his children drift through the wind
To think is a sin. To think is a sin
Long may his world never begin




We'll fall down
On broken knees
And we'll cry for you now
We'll cry for your mercy

We believe in love
We believe in love
God save us now
We believe in love

We degrade ourselves
But we dig our own grave
Jesus Christ the Lord
Save us now

We believe in love
We believe in love
God save us now
We believe in love

You said all my life
Would be in vain
If I gave up on anything
I knew to be true
Or a provable lie

So I believe in love
I believe in love
God save us now
I believe in love

And I open the door
And there they lie
Twisted and misshapen
They suffer for love

And they're sick to death
Of the dreams they used to have
And they're sick to death
Of their beautiful lie

God save us now
God save us now
God save us, please
Save us now

We believe in love
We believe in love
God save us now
We believe in love
God save us, please










Oxygen
 Luchen
Oxygen

Oxygen, Amen
Oxygen, Amen
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
Oxygen, I come in, come in
Oxygen, I am coming


Black oil smoke
Thick blue sky
Dead red eye
Hear me cry
Eat my throat
Feed my mind
Yellow eye: Feel me cry
Take me now
Peel my skin
Scrape my vein
Seal me in
Break my bones
Dance and spin
Cut a hole
Feed me now!
I'll steal all the oxygen!
La la la la luh luh luh luh luh


Hey there
Dog Man!
Woof woof woof woof woof!
Now I drink from your bowl, hello!
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff!
Hey there
Mr Skull
I'm not scared
Of your cull
Oxygen, oxygen
Skin tight, skin tight
Brick house, brick house
Oxygen! Amen! Oxygen! Amen!
Breathe in! Breathe in!




Oxygen
Oh man
I cannot breathe
Again

Oxygen
Come in
Burn my lungs
Be my friend
Come in

Well it's hard to get air
When your neck is a fist
And it's hard to walk a stair
When your leg will not lift
It's hard to stay alive
Stuffed with cold clay inside
It's hard to control your own mind
When there's nowhere left to hide
From the fact you can't breathe
Through a hole that is closed
From the panic now growing
Like an oily black smoke

Oh oxygen
Please come in
I can see the blue sky
Just up ahead
But it's sticky and thick
And it's true color?
It is red

Hey there, dark man
Now I drink from your bowl
Hey there, Mr. Skull
I'm not scared of your call
Gonna go outside
I'll go out in the snow
Gonna rip off my skin
Gonna burn up my clothes
Gonna read my own bones
I'll dance and I'll spin
I'll cut a clean hole through solid air and I'll steal all the oxygen
And my father will guide me up a road to the sky
With my mother beside, my last breath will expire

Oxygen!
Oxygen!
Aw man
Aw man
I cannot breathe
Again

My old friend
Goodbye
I give up
Now I finally decide
I am free of your grip
I refuse to even try
I refuse to even try




We're drifting goodbye
On a rust-colored cloud
Oh fallopian friends
Abandon us now
Our cisterns are full
Of bones ground to dust
The sky shows a bruise
Where our fingers have touched
Come suck on this vine
It tangles and nets
Come swallow the wine
We squeeze from our breast
The ocean is shifting
We're sailing the muck
The methane is rising
To heaven above
We're tracing our shape
On the walls of your house
We're surfing the sand
That spills from your mouth
We're coming for more
Cause nothing is left
The words are all gone
There's more to be said

Send us away
On ships made of silk
Send us to fly
Black skies washed with milk
People like us
We need a dream to escape
People like us
We need to sleep to awake




I want power, because it feels good
I want power - I'll wash America with blood
I want power: a clear blue light in the sky
I feel power, running through my veins and out my eyes

And into empty, godforsaken minds without reality
I feel power, I feel a sacrifice
I am dead to right or wrong

I want power, just like our father knew
I want power, I'll put my hands in you
I want power, though the Earth is lost and spinning
I feel power, buried in the ground
Where twenty million died like heroes
Stealing this same power that I'm feeling

I feel power, I feel a sacrifice
Now my blood is feeling clean
And I feel the power burning like a spear inside of me
I feel good, I feel right, I feel a sacrifice





Use sex for control
Use power for power
Use hate for freedom
Use money for cruelty
Use money for cruelty


Take control and keep it
Take control and keep it
Don't let go
Don't let go


He was your friend
She was your friend
He was your friend
She was your friend
They were wrong, they were wrong
They were wrong, they were wrong
Turn against them
Turn against them
Sex, power
Money, hate


Take control and keep it
Take control and keep it
Don't let go
Don't let go


Power for power
Power for power
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power
Power for power
Power for power's sake




Why be ashamed of hatred
There's nothing wrong with burning
I work hard for everything I own
Everything I own chokes me when I sleep

Why be ashamed of burning
Why be ashamed of burning
You do what you want
Then you cut out your heart

You do what you want
You burn out your heart
You burn out my heart
Then you eat my heart
You cut out your heart
Then you eat your heart

You burn it
Then eat it
You burn it
Then you eat it




My man walks on hands and knees
I am his first and only child
I am his only true love
I am his only real love

He is mine
He is my saint
He brings me roses and incense
And he closes my mind
Yes, he closes my mind
With real love
Real love
Real love
Real love

I will kiss the ground
Where he left a taste
Of his strength of mind
Take me down
Take me down now
Take me down

Into the cold dead earth
Take me down
Take me down
In your hands again
Take me down
Take me down
With real love
Real love
Real love
Real love

When I dream that sweet dream
When I forget where I am
I will always remember
Your hand on my shoulder
Pulling me down
Pulling me down

Into the cold dead earth
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down there
With real love
Real love
Real love
Real love









And what do I do
With the gift you held me as entered me
The one no one else would buy
They would not accept the filthy premise of your most terrible innocence
Oh, oh ho ho
So let them say, how were you wild
For what you really were was tender
Yes how you screamed, all through the night
Yet silent tears streamed down in morning light
Most beautiful, my lonely sinner




Reeling the liars in
We are reeling the liars in
We are removing their face, collecting their skin
We are reeling the liars in

We are burning them in a pile
We are burning them in a pile
The only true thing, the place to begin
Is to burn up the liar pile

Now the sun will hide beneath the ridge tonight
Clear flames of revenge will lick the black sky
And I, I will sing as you eat their tongues
For I am the saint who will lead them to us

So I'm reeling the liars in, reeling the liars in
Here is my hand, now drive the nail in, I am reeling the liars in
Here is my tongue, now cut out my sin, we are reeling the liars in
There is only one way. One place to begin. By reeling this liar in

Now I've got nothing to look at
And I've got no pain to deny
And I've got nobody to bleed for
And I've got no sun to pull down from the sky
But I'm saved, yeah, I'm saved
And I don't understand it, I'm saved

If mercy were to hold me closely
And hide me in her place of no pain
The angels would throw down the water
They cried from one hundred million eyes

And I have a feeling that's growing
Somewhere behind my sleeping mind
Yeah, I'm saved, I'm saved
Yeah, I don't know why, but I'm saved

When sunlight falls on your shoulder
You look like a creature from Heaven
You're holy when you open your eyes
And look up inside that sheltering sky

And you're an angel, I'll never betray you
But I'll always be a lonely child
Yeah, still I'm saved
I'm saved
Yeah, I don't deserve it
But I'm saved

Wrap your skin around my skin
I don't feel your body
Wrap your mouth around my mouth
I don't feel your body
Hold you hands over my eyes
I don't feel myself when you hold me down
I hide in your warmth









See God's sun go down behind that hill
See God's sons go down that lonely road
See God's sun fall behind that hill in darkness
See God's sons go down that godforsaken road

Then see us need more
Then see no more
Then see no more
Then see no more

See us deliver where other men will fail
See us hold Heaven while others burn in Hell
See us, God's sons, guarding Heaven's gate
Then see our sun go black because we made one mistake

Then see us need more
Then see no more
Then see no more
Then see no more

Standing naked in the corner
Sinking into the ground
Our hands connected to our feet
Our shadows burnt in the wall
Like the insomniac dreams


Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension


Strapped to the chair
Skin peeled back
Turned inside out
Shows the sickening fact


Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension


Connecting tongues in the basement
X's tongue move moves down Y's throat
Y spits it back and fills X: stalemate
Tied together in a permanent knot
Pressed together into one face
They trade a sound that comes up from the stomach
And spits in the other one's throat


Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension




I will pray
I will pray
I will go down low
And I will pray to you
Down as low as I can go

I will go there
And I will pray to you
I will beg you
I will beg you Lord
I will deny myself
I will deny you, Lord

Though I've done nothing wrong
Never in my life
No no no no no

I will beg you, Lord
And I will pray for you
To forgive me now
I will go down to the centre of the earth
And I will curl up in flames
And I will beg you, Lord

Take me in your cruel arms
Take me down home
And will say
"Come into me, lord, come in now
Come on in
Praise the Lord!
Praise God!"

Come into my heart, sweet Lord
Come into my heart
I am open
I am torn apart
I am naked
And I am impure

I am sexless
I am foul
And I am ignorant
And I am hateful
Forgive me, Lord

Come in
Come on in
Praise God
Praise the Lord
Praise God
Praise the Lord
Forgive me, Lord




You can hear them out there
They're gonna follow you down
On the rocks
In the air
Inside your mind, they made you scared
Of all the lies that have been told
Of all the hearts now that have been sold
Of all the tears that've been disowned
Those cries are gonna swallow up
The seeds you have sown

So hold on and make it last
Hold on for your last holy breath
Hold on for your faith
It has lapsed

Those cries like an acid
They will eat through your mask
Those cries like a hammer
They will nail down your past
Those cries gonna swallow up
Your last dying gasp

You can hear them out there
They come inside and ride you slow
They come inside where they will grow
Without a hope, without a dream
Without anything
Without a demon to turn the key

Of all the lies now that have been told
Of all the hearts now that have been sold
Of all the tears that've been disowned
Those cries are gonna swallow up the seeds you have sown
Those cries gonna get ya, chill you down to the bone
Those cries like an acid they will eat through your mask
Those cries gonna swallow up your last dying gasp

So hear them now
All the dead-eyed souls who've spent their lives and just grown old
So hear the cries from the dead-eyed souls who've spent their lives
Now they're turning cold





Now I just want to thank you
For going insane
Every second that you suffer
Is a loss that I gain
Every breath is a drain down
Down into a hole
And your mind is a shrinking thing:
It was crushed by your skull
Now you feel time unfolding
Deep in your chest
And your body's expanding
Now there's none of you left
So I just want to thank you
For losing your mind
Yeah you burned just like Joan of Arc
Purified by the flames


You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive!


Now I just want to thank you
For the light that you spread
And magnesium and sulphur
And the fear in your head
And I just want to tell you
You're nothing so new
Every time that you touch it
It'll turn against you
Now your future's a cold thing
Down in the damp ground
And your memory's a lead room
Containing this sound
So I just want to thank you
For killing your mind
All the life that you bleed out
Well I steal it for mine


You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive!

And she sits there by the wall
Making holes where I just stood
And her hands, they touch her face
Like her face is made of wood

And she holds onto a memory
Of something I never said
But she still can't quite remember
If my eyes are blue or dead

She's the mother of us all
She's the victim of my sadness
And the more she tries to know it
The more she'll never fill it

She's a universal emptiness
A universal emptiness
She's a universal emptiness
And a total lack of faith

And I saw her once before
Down on her bended knees
Through a window of the church at night
Confessing to the broken priest

She is holy, as all women are
And she suffers like a saint
Yeah, she touched my hand with cruelty
But I was punished far too late

She's the mother of us all
She's the victim of my sadness
And the more she tries to know it
The more she'll never fill it

She's a universal emptiness
A universal emptiness
She's a universal emptiness
And a total lack of faith

There is a growing
Golden light
A flower unfolding
Behind the mirror of your eyes

If an angel could hold it
In his polished white hand
I know he'd release it
Like a bird to the sky

Now you are the warrior
Who will conquer this land
On a horse made of clouds
You will scatter the sands

Some people say
God is long dead
But I heard something inside you
With my head to your chest

Within
All the wrong
They say
I have done

There lies
A seed
Of a million more
Just waiting to become

Send them home!
Send them home!
Send them home!

Use your sword
Use your voice
And destroy
And destroy

Then begin again




Now the past is untrue, and this breath is a lie
And the sun is an emptiness that burns through the sky
And this ground - it will slide down, down into the sea
And when this body dies, no man will ever breathe one word of ignorance for me
So bury your trust beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to consume

Now the earth bleeds cold water in my open hands
But their bodies bleed poison and they swallow the sand
And we'll walk to the river, where we will die of a thirst
And my fate, it's no question
Every fool, he is broken beneath the same holy curse

So bury your love beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to burn to sand




The sun is rising over the buildings across the street
The sun is God's face looking down at me as he cries for what he's done
I will survive my life if I close my mind
To all the things I could never, never, never, never, never, never be

You used to be there when I'd cry
Though you'd not see fit to comfort me
I don't need you anyway, and I'll never call you back to me
But I miss the way your body looks when you lay there naked next to me

But I won't cry, no, I will survive the light of the sun as it enters me
Let it come right in, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in
Let it come on it, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in

Now they say that Hell is a place where memory's dead
And the only thing left is this moment moving further away
But I will always try to remember the way you moved your lips
Against mine in the lonely bed
If I forget who you were then, I will lose what I am now
Forever and ever and ever and ever again

But I won't cry, no, I will survive the light of the sun as it enters me
Let it come right in, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in
Let it come on it, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in





Inhuman and stupid
The idiot crawls into a crack
And eats his food
A diet of pain
He completely ignores closing his mouth
He closes his mind
He talks to himself
And listens
And says


Speak
Speak
Speak


Talk to me in my sleep
Talk to me in my sleep
Walk me to the corner and strike a match
Put it on my tongue
And say


Speak
Speak
Speak
Speak
Speak

The day I was born, your shadow fell across my mother's breast
When I opened my eyes, you coloured my mind
Every move I make, is by your desire
Every move I make, is by your hand only
Now I'm still a child, but I'm closer to death
Cover me in roses, gently touch me while I sleep
When I dream I'll dream of drowning in a pool of scented blood
Now I'm still a child, but I'm closer to death
You said "take this it's yours" so I've kept it locked away
Now you're curled up beneath me in a pool of your own blood
Now I'm still a child, but I'm closer to death




I'm your stupid child
I'm your stupid helpless child
I'm your stupid naked child
I'm your stupid helpless child

I'm ashamed of what I am
I like the way that feels
I like the way that burns me
I like the way that dulls me
I like the way that cuts me down

I'm your stupid child
I'm your stupid child















Play with a pig, and you become a pig
Play in the mud, and you sink in the mud
Fall in a hole, and you stay in a hole
You'll be there to look at


At the top of the stairs
They're talking about you
And when they come down, they'll know what to do to you
They've worked out a scene according to your weakness


According to how you can be used


L-L-L-Look at the monkey s-s-s-suck and pull
L-L-L-Look at the monkey c-c-c-chew on his leash
B-B-B-Because he wants control of his movements
Of his movements, of his movements


According to how you can be used
According to how you can be used
According to how you can be used
According to how you can be used




And we steal our experience from an object that suffers
But the brightest pain leaves a shadow on no one
I saw you through the window masturbating to the violence
And the blood and the bodies floated through the blue sun
And the green earth turns to flesh in your hand
And the ether was born in the lungs of an ancient man
We hallucinated at night
Our mind's in the light
But I can't feel the body of the image which is now penetrating my sight
But you're beautiful
And you're real
Are you beautiful?
Are you real?

And my body begins where your memory ends
You were melted from stone
I was touched by your hands
I can feel it when pleasure moves up your spine
I can tell we're alive because your blood just blended with mine
And the angels of heaven never sacrificed a sensation as pure as the cut of this knife
And the wisdom contained in the telepathy of fear
Solidified our suffering into the droning sound I still hear
But you're beautiful
And you're real
Are you beautiful?
Are you real?

Hi, it's a sunny day, a beautiful day


You know, we do this for fifteen minutes or something
Talk to the man while he masturbates
You know, that was something I think--
I think I could do, you know
And coincidentally you don't ever meet the man
Or see the man
You have to listen to him groan and say disgusting things
But I suppose these things were only disgusting
If that's the way you're looking at it





In the screen
In the screen
The daughter in white water


In the screen
But not seen
Her hand describes the father


Stilted bones
Cloaked in foam
Squeeze laughter from the lather
Drink water from the daughter


Neither matter
Neither taste
Neither solid
Neither space
The daughter brings the water
The daughter brings clear water





Lord Jesus
Oh, Jesus
You're my only God
You're my only


Girl
I follow you now
I follow you down
To a dirty black room
Where the air is gone
I'll lie down on the table
And I'll wait for you
To step inside me now
Come inside me now, Jesus


Step inside me now
Come on, come on in


Oh, Jesus Christ
You're my only God


If I drink your blood
I will be like you
Girl I wanna be like you
I look into your eyes
And close my mind


Get out my mind
Get out my head


Oh, Jesus
You're my only God


*applause*
Thank you very much

Joseph is standing behind my back
Joseph is digging his hands in my chest
Joseph is drinking the light in my lung
Joseph is moving his tongue in my neck
Joseph is riding a vein in my head
Joseph is cutting my arm on his bed
Joseph is making my body fly
Joseph is making my body fly
Joseph is making my body fly
Joseph is making my body fly
Joseph is me and you are a liar!
Joseph is me and, ah you are a liar!
Joseph is me and, ah you are a liar!

And the endless crowds of people
They walk upon this stone
Where will their memory go
Where did their minds come from
And I was only a child
When I first looked in your eyes
And saw your body rise over the ocean

We saw the golden boy bleed love
Onto the sand like rain
While we were injecting colours
Into our open veins
And deep beneath the water
The dead black silence crawled

Far away across the ocean
The golden boy's beneath the sea
The golden boy swallowed by the sea

And love is sometimes violent
And violence has no constraint
And I can see inside you
Yes, I can feel what you think
And with this knife of silver
I will release your soul
And throw it out into the ocean

Nine million miles in a straight line
In a place just like this
In a ship on the water
Where no dimensions exist
My hands are holding your picture
And the image, it shifts
I tear it up and scatter it over the ocean
...The golden boy that was swallowed by the sea




One second burns for a billion years
And time is relative
And light is physical
We feel your body
We feel your feelings
We see the eye of god shine through the citadel
And space is empty behind the universe
The past and future were simultaneous
Inside your body we feel your emptiness
The light we breathe in is your unconsciousness
And your body disappears
Burning backwards through the years
And in your hands time was made
And through breathing
You'll erase it
But we can see forever
Before love and hate
And we will fall right through the wall of the place where we were made
Right into the open mouth of the great annihilator




Someone was here before me
And they took the possibility away
And without any control or freedom
The elements were laid down in this way

And so my mind is slowly devoured
By the ideas to which it subscribes
And in the end, I'm left with nothing
Except the memory of believing my own lies
And where are you now, my most unfortunate lie

The light shows my face in the mirror
And my hand as it reaches to touch
The evidence of pain and delusion
And a mind which was never clear enough

I saw the sun rise in an ancient desert
Where this moment was first foretold
And the black water was thick as blood
And my hands, they were full of gold

And where are you now, the most lethal, all-consuming lie I ever told
Where are you now, my unfortunate, irreversible lie




I won't think it
I won't speak it
But I feel it
And I see it

And it comes down and surrounds us
With sensation
With perfection
Without purpose

And there's color
And there's light
And there's movement
On the other side of the world

With each movement
New reactions cause sensations
Which move through us
And the warm wind kissed your body

And the sun was rising on the other side of the world
And there's color
And there's light and sensation
On the other side of the world

Now I breathe it
And I see it before thinking
And it's perfect
Without purpose

And there's color
And there's light
And they're rising
On the other side of the world




Oh my father, he was born beneath the water
And my mother, she was born to no one's daughter
And I, I was born beneath the dying sun
Born from the mouth of a river that would not run dry

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie
Oh, the river that runs with love, it won't run dry
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie

Well, I awoke this morning in the blackest night
And a million stars were aching in the sullen sky
And I heard the great machines as they bled and cried
And I saw the end of the world, I had no question why

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie
Hold on to the one you love and kiss her before she dies
Oh, the river that runs with love, it won't run dry

Oh, my father made the water when he cried
But the river that runs with love, it won't run dry
And the sun will burn a hole in the purple sky
But the river that runs with love, it won't run dry





I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all

I love you too much
I love you too much
I love you too much
I love you too much
Son, son
The common mind
The coal in my mouth
The coal in my mind
The common mind





Behind the veil of silver scars, there is a special inverted star
He's a greasy beast, heaving in a field of sticky black mud

I'm down here naked
There's a hole in my chest
Both my arms are broken
Pointing east and west
Your life pours into my mouth
My light pours out of my mouth
My life pours into your mouth
Your light pours into my mouth
Your life pours into my mouth
My light pours out of my mouth
My life pours into your mouth
Your life pours into my mouth

There's a jagged deep crack in the crust of the earth, spreading from north to south

Put your light in my mouth (x8)

Ahh the mountains are crumbling
Ahh the canyons are thundering
All the people are fucking
They're just a pile of writhing selfish bliss

I know I'll never die. I scream up at the sky:

You have arrived

Hey
Bring the children home





And wide are your delusions
Deep red is the space behind your eyes
Closed forever is the door to your room
But inside here, there lives the sound
You despise, but I love
You despise, what I love
You despise, I love
You despise, I love




Mother, I…
Mother, I…
I was wrong
I am wrong…
You were wrong
I am wrong




We're standing by a river
In a place where nothing moves
And the white light in the sky
Is meaningless and cruel

And we turn our face away
From a cold and violent wind
And we bow our heads down
And we pray to the sound of freedom

With a mirror in my hand
And my eyes burned in the fire
Drunk on self-deception
And punished by desire

Leaping directly into a bright white sea
I'll keep myself breathing
And I'll swallow the sound of freedom

Nobody else can see you
Nobody knows how you feel
Go further inside you
Where nothing else is real

Now throw yourself into a pool of silence you can see
And hold the mirror before your eyes
And light the white light
It's the sound of freedom

Now time is just a picture
That moves before your eyes
And every lie that I believe
Is falsely compromised

And this is not a sound
And we are not alive
Someone else was here before
In someone else's mind

And the ground we walk is sacred
And every object lives
And every word we speak
Will punish or forgive

And the light inside your body
Will shine through history
Set fire to every prison
Set every dead man free

And the air we're breathing now
We breathed a million times
And the darkest dreams we dreamed
Were dreamed by other minds

So take us to the water
Take us to the sound
And wash my soul away
Where it can never be found

And the white light that surrounds us
Is the sound of freedom pounding
And the ground that opens up
Spits the fire from freedom's mouth

And the concrete, glass and steel
Break with a freedom you can feel
And the wind that blows through Heaven
It screams the sound of freedom

And the violence that destroys
Is the birth of freedom singing
And the lovers in the field
Make the sound of freedom bleeding

And the pain that eats my mind
Is the shout of freedom's life
And the sea that splits in two
Is the cut of freedom's knife

And the fire that burns this city
Is the white light in freedom's eye
And the white light is the sound of freedom





Now feed me through
The power line
Wash me in
Your bloodless light
To be splayed upon
Your silver gate
I am proud in flesh
I am bruised
But I am raised




Push it away
The world looks red
People with fish eyes
The ground sucks

Walk on my fingertips
Displacing the fog
The weight of my body is too much to bear
The memory drains the life from a dog

An ocean of insects works like a sheet
The immoveable fact buries my mind
In a horse-hair coat in a pile on the floor

Bury my mind
Bury mind
Bury my mind
Bury my mind

Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Maker Man
Follow the Keeper Man
Follow the Leaver Man

Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man




This is mine
I own it
I own this thing
I hate everything that I don't own

I own this
I own this hole
It's mine
Get out of my hole
It's mine
It's mine

When you touch my things, you spoil them
When things get dirty, I spit them out
I own this
I own this
It's mine
It's mine




The only real thing's misery
Submission means you get murdered
You get revenge when you wait for it
Frustrated means you're insane
He's a dead thing under the sheet
Causing pain
Sex turns impotence into decay
Unconscious repression degrades the real thing
You can't kill a criminal need
You're polluted with fear you need comfort
You can't kill what you can't see
You can't' think what you don't own
You can't rub what you don't recognize
You don't get what you really deserve
You can't fight if you don't feel it
Obedience pays if you use it right
When you eat your pain you keep your nerve
You degrade yourself when you hide your fear
Use it right
Or don't feel it
Use it right or don't feel it

To be kind, to be kind
To be kind, to be kind
To be kind, to be kind
To be real, to be new
To be sung by a song that's untrue
The falling sun, the fallen one
In a bed, painted blue, touching you
Listening, just listening
To the rain, to the wind, in the field
To be kind, to be kind
To be lost, in a bed, touching you
To be lost, to be lost
To be found in the sound of this room
There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes
There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes
There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes
There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes










Because I love you
I give you this
Don't be afraid of this
You can trust me now
Though we will deceive ourselves
You can trust me now
You can trust me now
Don't be afraid of this
It's not unusual
It's not unusual
Because I love you
You can trust me now
You can not trust me now
You will never know

Your lipstick smear across your face
Now toss your hair in dirty grace
Pink leather strap on your guitar
Now spread your legs - how bright you are
They all know your name
Collie, claw your way to fame


There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she shows it
There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
A star in her mind yeah she shows it
And every evening the sun comes up when she goes down
And every evening the mud fills up her bridal gown


The little girl inside of you
Has made her wish come true
And tonight you take the stage
You wear a dress of blood and lace
You left a stain where you have kneeled
But Collie, you're still invisible


There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she shows it
There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
A star in her mind yeah she shows it
And every evening the sun comes up when she goes down
And every evening the mud fills up her bridal gown


Your lipstick smear across your face
Now toss your hair in dirty grace
Pink leather, strap on your guitar
Now spread your legs just like a star


And I'd like to eat her breasts and know God
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to taste her flesh and grow hard
(There's a star in her mind)
And I'd like to eat her breasts and grow God
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to suck her breath and blow hot
(There's a star in her mind)
I'd like to eat her breasts and know God
(There's a star in her eyes)
I'd like to taste her flesh and grow God
(There's a star in her mind)
I'd like to eat her breasts and grow God
I'd like to suck her breath and blow hot

When I die let me down
In the field in the ground
Where the water runs beneath me
And the sky's red and falling down
Round my eyes that I closed
And the world that I know
Is a shadow of a dream
That left me in my loneliness
Without a life behind me
That I can say I ever knew
That I can say I ever knew
That I can say I ever lived at all

Now I'm a drunken man
And I'm killing time
From what was mislaid
I've never been alive
I was never born in blood
I've never breathed a word
And the people that I knew
The women and the thieves
They left my body bleeding
On this piece of fallow ground
They left my body bleeding
On this piece of closing in
They left my body bleeding
On this piece of emptiness

They left my body bleeding
On this piece of fallow ground
Where famine comes before me
And cuts my people down
Where the brown cloud shuts the sun
And locusts eat our food
And the blood of lamb is spilled
And smeared across the altar
And the colors red and gold
Put their flavor in our soul
And the children are born blind
And the water turns to blood
And we're sheltered by our god
Who's hand is strong and bloody
And we're walking earth that's filled
With the bodies that he's killed
To get our people free
To get our people out
To get our people free
To get our people out
He'll drown em in black waters
He'll send a swarm of flies
Yeah, he'll slaughter those that kill us
And he'll punish them that hide
Where was it decided?
Where was it described
That a man he gets no substance
That as he lays there as he dies
He ceases to believe
He was ever born in blood
That his eyes have ever seen
That his hands have ever held
That his lungs have ever breathed
That he's ever been alive
Was he ever live?
Was he ever live?
Was he ever live?
Was he ever live?





I don't feel pain
I never escape
I'm under the bed
I'm licking the floor


I never dream
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
Not real


You know everything
I forget how to breathe
You're touching my chest
When I'm touched, I bleed


I never dream
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real


Not real
Not real
Not real
Not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
Not real




When she comes here, then we'll see
Then we'll know, then we'll breathe
In her shadow, the sun was born
In her shadow, a new world will form

When she breathes, when she breathes
When she imagines that she breathes in me
When she breathes, when she thinks it once
In the field, steel grass will grow

And from Heaven, she'll rain down the sun
And turn the living into sand
And we breathe her holy air
And we walk this poison place

Made from an emptiness where time was never
Dreamed by one mind so sad as mine
When she breathes, when she breathes
When she thinks it once, when she breathes in me





One, two, three, four


His hands are on my throat
My key is in his eye
I'm splayed here on some curb
Shards of glass
A starry night
When will this pig-man stop?
His stink is like a dog
My life is mine to keep
I still kill him in my sleep
The car door is open wide
The mouth of death still calls my name
I'll beat him on his face
And I stab with all my strength
And I scream until he goes
I scream until he's gone
Then I crawl across the road
Then I crawl across the road
When will I return?
When will I return?


(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive

Oh I'm alive




The future's leaking through a shut lead door
In the ruins of a city under the forest floor
Your naked body's buried in a vacant field
What does your body feel now

The air is black and has no oxygen
The bodies in the river float beneath the sun
Transparent skin it shines a light from deep within
Where does your body begin

The stars are hidden by a mirrored sky
And darkness disappears behind reflected light
Perception is a distance in a closed-in space
How will your body escape

The crowd is feeling you inside your head
Your imagination's canceled by its opposite
And every possibility's been proved untrue
Now is your body you




Now I'm not a man and I don't feel love
And I don't see anything coming down from above
But this world spins slowly and I see a light
Rising up from behind the horizon up into the clear black sky
But I don't see you in my line of sight
In fact, I can't remember why we are alive





My heart pumps
My legs move
I sit down, I rot
I hide my stink
I follow directions
I know how to work
I keep my mouth shut
I know my place
I know my place
I hide my stink
I need you more
Than I hate myself
I need you more
Then I need myself
You hurt me
Then you hurt yourself
You hurt me
And you hurt yourself
You hurt me
And you hurt yourself
You hurt me
And you need yourself
You need me
And you need yourself
You hurt me and


Why hide the lie?
Oh, why hide?
Oh, why?
Oh, why hide the lie?
Oh, why hide?
Oh, why?
Oh, why hide the lie?
The lie
The lie
Oh, why hide?
Oh, why?
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide the lie
Why hide the lie?
Oh, why hide the lie?
Oh, why hide the stinkin' lie?
Oh, why?
Oh, why?




I'll drink the moonlight from your hands
I'll swim an ocean filled with sorrow
No lover, please don't go
We can crucify tomorrow

Let the sunlight feed the air
Let it fill our lungs with lies
We'll be memorized by shadows
But our loneliness will survive

Now the sugar in your soft voice
Makes the sweetness in your weeping
And the black rose that you swallowed
Feeds the solitude you're dreaming

No, I'll never taste your tears again
In the darkness that we're breathing in
Now the sun will kill the garden
In a universe that is bleeding




Now, diamonds are falling
Through a new wound in the sky
Obsessions, pink children
They are laid out in a line
They are screaming, they are polluting
They are demanding their life
These wrong feelings, they are calling
The red leper of time
I love you, I need you
Oh, show me how to shine
I love you, young flower
Now give me what is mine




Now diamonds are falling
(?..) In the sky
Obsessions being children
They are let out in the light
They are screaming
They are polluting
They are demanding
They are alive
These wrong feelings

They are calling the red leopard of time
I love you. I need you
Oh show me how to shine
I love you. Your flower
Now give me what is mine




And nothing is written in the book, reality is made by you
And every lie that you pursue, eventually turns true
And I was told that your eyes would shine a light up into space
And infinity would then consume this ordinary place

You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all

I saw you standing in the fire, beneath a crimson moon
The ocean whispered on the shore and echoed in the ruins
Inside your body is a clear blue light and time was made from this
Your shadows swallow everything it feels, you punish us with bliss

You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all

I'm sorry, I need you, I love you more than myself
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I won't do it again

I am your only friend
I am your only friend
I am your only friend
I am your only friend




I don't know where I am
I'm dancing in my corpse
I don't remember anything

I'm wearing your flesh
Your flesh is my face
I love your face
I wrap your flesh around my face

When I wear your flesh, I love myself
When I wear your flesh, I love face
I wrap your flesh around my flesh
Then I love my flesh

I love your face
All I can do is kill
All I can do is kill
I love your flesh around me




You never close your eyes
When I am near you
You never say you know me
When I am inside of you

Girl, you know it's only a feeling
Girl, you know you lie and you steal
When you take my trust in your body
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real

You are another person
When you are alone
Nothing moves inside you
No one holds you down

Girl, you know it's only a feeling
You should never trust what you feel
When you forget your body
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real

You never close your eyes
When I am near you
You never say you know me
When I am inside of you

Girl, you know it's only a feeling
Girl, you know you lie and you steal
When you take my trust in your body
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real

You're not real

I saw a white finger on a barbed wire fence
I knew it was dangerous but I took the risk
And yes it was sweet so sweet to eat
Now see how the flesh is pricked and bleeds
Yeah it bleeds. It bleeds. Yeah it bleeds. See how it bleeds
