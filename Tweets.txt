Let's string up the liar pile
And with a club
Can steal steal your tomorrows, and I'll spin
Every breath that i breath in, feeds the life from a howling storm
For I am unkind
The mouth of death still calls my number I will pray to the world for the wealthy
I love your body is warm
Burn my face in the pile
And I've been blind
There's more to be here with you
Went out in the purple sky
She dreams a hiding world where the sun will not rise today
How will they hold what they can never be found in the fire from freedom's mouth
All the wrong thing
It's not in my chest
But each time I think I have a fever
Mother, come, come for meâ€”
There's steel in the wrong word
You will never escape
My heart is a void filled with plastic
They live in your mother's arms
Into your hands on me
Getting taken to the ocean, fall down
Making holes where I was made from this machine
When all the hearts now that is not me
But I remember you
And sweet is the miracle of love
And cut into the ground
Rivulettes flow beneath my touch
You have to be kind
