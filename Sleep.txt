The slaves emerge with sunken face
The progress of mankind stand still

Viewing the landscape
Rotting existence that your government has created

Throughout your life
Skeleton (unclean)

The slaves emerge with sunken face
The progress of mankind stand still
Viewing the landscape of a rotting existence




Trapped inside a world under leagues of ocean
The clergy arrives with the magic potion

I put my mouth into the cup of potion
Sip down the nectar and escape the ocean

Reaching for the sun, leave Atlantis, escape the sea
Fly into the sky, leave behind Atlantean key
Reaching for the sun, leave Atlantis, escape the sea
Fly into the sky, leave behind Atlantean key

Escape the sea with ascending motion
I touch the sun and return to ocean




Born under water
Raised to drown
By an anatomy of tears

The water crashes against the neck
Of a reluctant child
Born without an abdomen

Melt the hammer that breaks the hearts...
It will wait under a diaphragm sky
A ruptured diaphragm sky

Die
Die
Die




Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff filled land
Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff filled land

Proceeds the weedian - Nazareth
Proceeds the weedian - Nazareth

Creedsmen roll out across the dying dawn
Sacred Israel holy mountain Zion
Sun beams down on to the sandsea reigns
Caravan migrates through deep sandscape

Lungsmen unearth the creed of Hasheeshian
Procession of the weed-priests to cross the sands
Desert legion smoke-covenant is complete
Herb bails retied on to backs of beasts
Arise arise arise - The Son of the God of Israel
Jordan river flows on evermore
Bathe in glow of sunlight’s beating rays
They feel the serpent's standard rule our days

Stoner caravan emerge from sandsea
Earthling inserts to chalice the green cutchie
Groundation soul finds trust upon smoking hose
Assembled creedsmen rises prayer-filled smoke
Raise up seer’s holy prophecy
Plants down on upon years of the sun now feeds
Seed of Eden fall on nurtured soil
Onward caravan prepare new bong

Weed-priests creedsman chant the right
Judgement soon come to Mankind
Green herbsmen serve rightful king
Hemp seed caravan carries

The molten fire flowed up toward Zion
Flight of the nazarene to seek the cheribum
Rides out believer with the spliff aflame
Marijuanaut escapes earth to cultivate

Grow-room is church temple of the new stoner breed
Chants loud-robed priest down on to the freedom seed
Burnt offering redeems – completes smoked deliverance
Caravan’s stoned deliverance
The caravan holds to eastern creed - Now smokes believer!
The chronicle of the sinsemillian

Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff-filled land
Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke - Jerusalem




Ride the dragon toward the crimson eye
Flap the wings under Mars' red sky
The reptile pushes itself out into space
Leaving behind the human race

Swim inside the solar seas
The Nebula cries out to me
Passing where I've gone before
I fly through the crimson door




Insect caravan pulls its way
Through the freezing and misty haze
Gypsy casts a spell of frost
Frozen solid our lives are paused

Glass village lies below
Castle of sleet with magic glow
Trapped inside icy glaze
The burning sunlight sheds its rays

More light
More light
More light

Escape the tomb of deadly freeze
To the village of glass we have the keys
Ice people everywhere once inside
At home again the insects ride




Choir of the sun chants inside the anti moon
Shockwaves rattle the Earth below with hymn of doom
Chilled rays freeze below the eye of silver sun
Damned souls gather in valley of the evil one

Phantasmal specter of two worlds collide
Planetoid soaked in rays of electric light
Stoner caravan from deep space arrives
Rides on the suncraft toward the glowing eye

Walk with the cleric under eye of silver sun
Damned souls gather in valley of the evil one
Choir of the sun chants inside the anti moon
Shockwaves rattle the Earth below with hymn of doom




Slumber killed by rays of the new red sun arising
Dreamer wakens to spectral gaze of light rays shining
Black steed carries him across the astral sand
Rides alone is the man from the magic caravan

I believe the signs of the reptile master
Sunbound spacepod rising faster
Earth drenched in black under starless sky above
Man on the mountain sets free the holy dove

Look onto the rays of the new stoner sun rising
Sonic Titan rides out on clouds of new horizon
Look onto the rays of the new stoner sun rising
Sonic Titan rides out on clouds of new horizon




Travelling toward the atomic sky
Passing through the wall of light we fly
To the center of the sun we go
Discovering secrets no one else has known
Within the center of the galaxy
Away from Earth and all its misery

Travelling toward the atomic sky
Passing through the wall of light we fly
Toward the center of the sun we go
Discovering secrets no one else has known
Within the center of the galaxy
Away from Earth and all its misery
Pressing on into the burning sky
Burning spaceship it's time to die

Our ship explodes
Our work is done
We've left our lives
Inside the sun

I always knew I was better

Zzz holes up under your sweater

Niggas wanna run off with my concepts
Niggas wanna run off with my hunnids
(pewpewpewpewpew) mc hammer ima waste you
No you can't touch this
I can't fuck him he clumsy
I fuck with her she fuck my bro
I always thinking about the benni hunnids lunches back when you was eating lunchables


I always knew I was better
That's how i rock this margiela
He bitching now imma king
I gotta keep it 
(psht) but people do not say a thing
I got this silencer on a beretta

Niggas swear they special we pull up that interest
New chain look like christmas i got his bitch interest
Taught me like the pinterest booty 4 dimensions
Need a fork to lift it yo boyfriend out my mentions
Bitch i am as gone as gym class
Sipping that lean like its slim fast
100 zippers on my denim got these YSL's looking like they trip pants, niggas be fucking with hoes and they swear they bag got a bag of fake implants
These niggas hate me cus i got a eagle
But they bourbon bag call me 10 bands

_______?
Have fallen to the earth this day

People go their separate ways
_______?

Majestic tree of life decays
Human did not change its ways

The sun is set from sky to sea
Mankind meets his destiny

Majestic tree of life decays
Sun is set from sky to sea
Mankind meets it's destiny

Malady
Malady




Crushing of soul
Rotting of spirit
Degradation of mind

Black sphere battling
Unsustained life giver

The rapped mother spits
Mother spits




The surgeon removes an open heart
And scrapes it clean give it a heart machine

Why

The surgery failed
Their hands remain clean cannibal machine

Pray for the eyes
The eyes of the prey
That are clinched tight in the fist of a butcher









Look in the eye of unknown enchanted being
Plant from the moon and stars can help me see it
Look in the eye of unknown enchanted being
But you be fakin' reality
Look in the eye of unknown enchanted being
Plant from the moon and stars can help me see




Souls are siphoning
Spirit begins to drain -- to drain

Feel the presence of obscurity
Nailed to the saw of reality

Sad repressions
Deep impressions
In this womb
Remove and consume
Break control and remove this fetus




From the temple stone
Smokes the lambsbread
Through dream, sleep and in waking
Toward the weed fields
To That which holds the worlds
Walks the Sinsemillian

Refutes death
Remains stoned constantly
The dealer breaks the eclipse

Backpatch
All are stoned thereafter

Stoned chariot ascending
Smokes the true believer

Life complete
The dealer is my refuge

Heavy dry weight
Hasheeshian smoked relief

Backpatch
Iommic life complete




Far within the oaken tower
Exists the one with evil power
Magic channeler of earth's frustration
The Druid sleeps in meditation




Our children will die and the greed will continue
From the womb into pain and agony

Where pain and agony equal a profit -- a profit
The pain inside my head tries to control my life

What is a soul, a mind, constructed by social bind
What is a soul what is a mind, constructed




Souls of friction close your eyes
Will guide you to the other side

Astrosphere inviting you
Your spirit trapped in solitude

Altered celestial
Time cosmic

Wisdom flowing
Spirit

Soaring mental
Wisdom soaring and solstice
Eclipsed

Altered celestial
Time cosmic

Wisdom flowing and spirit
Eclipsed
